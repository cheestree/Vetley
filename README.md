# üêà Vetly
An all-in-one multiplatform veterinarian clinic manager web application.

Made for the Final Project of a BSc's in Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (Summer Semester 2024/2025).

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è But why?
Most companies nowadays tend to focus on creating one thing and one thing only, but improve it as best they can. Some have dedicated apps for each functionality. That's where _Vetly_ comes in.

_Vetly_ tries to fill in this gap of functionality and connectivity by giving both ends new ways to communicate and connect. Need to know what food you should give your dog when he's sick? You can get such info from guides or directly from a checkup with a vet. Managing your clinics inventory with multiple apps is tiresome? It takes care of it with a centralized system. Your parrot is having issues breathing and needs immediate attention? Some clinics might be available in your area to aid you.

## ‚ú®Features
